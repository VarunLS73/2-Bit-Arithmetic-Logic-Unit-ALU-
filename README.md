# 2-Bit-Arithmetic-Logic-Unit-ALU-
2-Bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) implemented using basic logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOT) and simulated using Cadence Virtuoso at a 90 nm CMOS technology node. The ALU is designed to perform basic arithmetic and logical operations, including addition, subtraction, AND, OR, NAND, and NOT operations.
